# NBATracker

This project was created in response to an open ended project assignment to build a functional web application utilizing REST APIs as well as Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
It can pull team and player data, game results, team rankings, game schedules and more. Additionally, the user can purchase tickets to upcoming games through
our web application. 

As this is a year old project for a studio course and our API subscription has expired, it is not currently up to date. While the framework of the website has not changed,
the populated date is either outdated or non-functional due to the lack of current API links. However, at the time of its development our web application was fully tested
and functional, with minimal bugs and accurate displays of statistics, schedules and more.
